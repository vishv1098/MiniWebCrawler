		<h3 style="color: green;">About Moto-X</h3>
		<p>&emsp;Moto X is a flagship Android smartphone developed and
			manufactured by Motorola Mobility. Released in August 2013, it was
			among the company's first new products after its acquisition by
			Google in 2012. Initially developed as the "X Phone", Moto X was
			primarily aimed at mainstream consumers, distinguished by features
			taking advantage of voice recognition and contextual awareness, the
			ability for users to custom-order the device in their own choice of
			color options, and emphasizing the fact that the phone was being
			final assembled in the United States.</p>
			<p>&emsp; Moto X was met with mostly positive reviews, with particular praise towards its hardware design,
			Motorola's new approach to customizing Android, along with its suite
			of contextual features, and the influence of its "mainstream"
			targeting on its overall performance, user experience, and battery
			life. Its camera, while praised for having a simple user interface,
			was panned, however, for having inconsistent image quality, and a
			lack of certain advanced features for the sake of simplicity.
