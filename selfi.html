		<h3 style="color: green;">About Nokia Selfi</h3>
		<p>&emsp;Microsoft is about to reveal two new phones, including a
			high-end model and a <strong>selfie model, code named ‘Superman’,</strong> according
			to a report. The Verge reported that Microsoft’s head of devices
			Stephen Elop showed off the two new models during an internal company
			meeting earlier this week. Both devices are expected to be announced
			and launched relatively soon. The Superman model’s features are
			understood to include a 5MP front-facing camera for better selfie
			shots with a standard 4.7-inch display. The public first became aware
			of the device back in April, when the company released initial
			details. </p>
			<p>&emsp;The second high-end phone Microsoft will reportedly launch
			is the code named <strong>‘Tesla’.</strong> This phone will more than likely be a
			replacement for the Nokia Lumia 720 with its PureView camera included
			in a bid to tackle the more affordable range of high-end phones. The
			news comes shortly after Jo Harlow of Microsoft also suggested the
			company will continue to roll a number of “high-end products” off the
			production line in the coming months. The company will also be
			rolling out its Windows 8.1.1 update.</p>
